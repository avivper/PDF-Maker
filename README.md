<h1 style="text-align:center;">PDF Maker</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">The idea of PDF Creator originated when I asked myself how I could create PDF files from an existing PDF file. I wanted to be able to extract specific pages or a range of pages and combine them into an entirely new file. Despite extensive searching, I couldn't find any tool, especially a simple one, that could fulfill my requirements. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create one myself, offering it freely to the community.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Purpose</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;">The main purpose of PDF Creator is to merge specific parts of various PDF texts into a single PDF file. However, I believe it will have even more uses beyond that initial intention.</p>
